# The Pyramids - Maxwell Mollison

Description: This program procedurally generates a scene of people around the pyramids in Egypt. The user can move a person around with their mouse and control the lighting on the pyramids.

This scene uses randomness by generating people in different positions and in different clothing. The pattern I noticed in the inspiring image was mainly just that there were a lot of people with minimal noticeable differences, so I decided to build a frame of a person and then randomize those differences.

This scene uses reactivity through the mouse. The movement of the sun was already included in the starter code, so I kept that and added a lighting effect on the pyramids. The shadowy side of the pyramids changes based on if the mouse is to the left or right of the tip of each pyramid. I also made it so one of the people moves towards the mouse so the user can walk around the scene.
 
Artist Statement: The effect I am trying to achieve is simulating a scene of people visiting the pyramids, with a little bit of realism thrown in there with the lighting and player movement. I'd say I mostly achieved that effect, though the player movement is very artificial because I couldn't get the keyIsPressed thing to work in time. That would have allowed for slightly more natural movement. I also wanted the player to get smaller as they walked into the distance, but I ran into problems with that too.
